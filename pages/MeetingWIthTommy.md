	- First lets review the grading team situation during the past two weeks of Christmas and new year holiday
		- We arranged some additional backup resources on holiday to maintain the total output above 500k. It even increased a lot from 500 - five-fifty last week, Because we have completed the latest batch of training
		- For the analyst team, there are 4 new hires starting training and 4 existing analysts has stated smart screen training
	- Besides, we met a blocking issue during last two weeks- alias creation got stuck due to the approvers were out of office
- Take a look at our next steps
	- The first one is about the team expansion plan- you may know that Last December we suspended adding new resources to the team. According to our previous grading team scaling timeline - we will restore increasing HCs starting from this week.
		- Just would like to confirm with you if this plan and budget is still valid, so that
	- The Bulk Subtypes update -
		- After several weeks of testing, I think we have collected enough data to test the effectiveness of the new rules.  I will start discussing our follow-up plans with Bob

	- hope everything is good with you
	- First, here is one follow-up for last week
		- All new resources planned for this month have been on boarded. and we adjusted the output baseline accordingly
	- Alias expiration
		- We have noticed that dozens of graders' Alias will expire next month.
		- As far as I know, the FTE manager will receive an extension request a month before
	- The first week of February is the Chinese New Year holiday.
		- Many graders in China team will be out of office and spending the holiday with their families.
		- This will have some impact on the production, but we've already got a back up plans to keep 24/7 coverage and maintain a stable total output
	- Conflict reduction / guideline redesigning

		- resource
		- interaction between grading team and analyst team
			- I have discussed with several analysts and reviewed our existing workflow. 
			  And we find that the cooperation between the two teams is limited to a few aspects.
				- For example on the knowledge level - we have a regular Q&A meeting with the analyst team to review and solve graders' confusion on sduring labelling
				- We can see all of these interactions are just single-directional that grading team is asking for help from analysts
			- Make connections in the opposite direction
				- for example The grader can check the effect of analyst rules in some way
			- External indicators will interfere with grader's judgment
