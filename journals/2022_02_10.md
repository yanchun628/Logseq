	- We are temporarily unable to post screenshots of test emails on the team wiki due to compliance restrictions. Therefore, we are planning to compile emails with high conflict-ratio into the new round of daily PKT.
	- At the same time, with the announcement of our new guideline, we plan to use the Daily PKT as a very important way of gathering & providing feedback and synchronizing graders' knowledge to make sure they are understanding the new guideline in the same way.
	- We will restart sending daily PKT forms from next Monday. The new test paper will contain  questions from graders while they are trying to follow the new guideline, and high-frequency mistakes from overlap study.
	- We will follow the new guideline to formulate questions and write answers/explanations. Please let your grader participate the test in time
