		- 1. quick check with david, got chance to confirm with Tommy?
		- 2. take a look at the overall metrics and numbers
			- Since we entered June, grading team's weekly total throughput has been steady at over 7 hundred K, including around one -fifty k from consumer pipeline
			- the reason for this increasing trend is that we are adding new graders and our tool, kestudio is working very good recently without any performance issue.
		- We are keep getting the overlap study on a bi-weekly basis. there have been 20 rounds of testing so far since last september and I collected the important metrics here
			- comparing the first cycle with the latest recent cycle we can see the improvements in all aspects
			- I think that proves the effect
			- what we didn't do well is about the conflict ratio controll
			- introduced a new metric called 'misclaffication' rate. we can easily consider it as graders' error rate for the testing cases. our new target for this rate is below 12% by the end of next semester
			- I feel very positive and optimistic to keep this test and welcome the consumer overlap study
		- 下周的 availability
