	- 我想要为本次的知识更新带来一些变化 —— 在处理完大量清晰、简单的易错点之后，我仍然从大家的conflict case发现有残留的一些模糊不清的scenario，并且我感觉一个人很难做出决定。这些scenario中通常不存在right/wrong，往往从两方面都make sense。因此我在这里将这些困难的scenario收集起来并设计了一份投票，里面包含几个简单的案例与问题。我真诚地希望听到你们的反馈，知识更新计划根据你们反馈的结果来制定，并让broader team 来跟随
		- I want to bring some changes to our new guideline updates - after dealing with a lot of clear and simple mistake patters, there were still some ambiguous scenarios found from recent overlap study cases, and I just feel difficult and hesitant making decisions for them. Usually there is no 'right or wrong' in these scenarios, and they often make sense from both sides.
		- So here I collected these difficult scenarios and designed a poll with a few samples and simple questions. I sincerely hope to hear your feedback, and the next knowledge update will be developed based on the results submitted by you to let our broader team to follow.
	- 请将这份survey分享给更多你们的team leads 或你们信任的senior,experinced grader。请注意，不分对错，我们唯一的目的只是顺应大多数人的意见，减少conflict。
		- Please share this survey with any of your team leads or senior, experienced graders that you trust to get more accurate results. Note: there are no right or wrong answers, my only intention is to go along with the majority and reduce conflicts.
	- description : 本调查从最近的几期overlap study中收集了一些仍然悬而未决的模糊/困难的scenario。你的意见非常重要，将成为后面的知识更新的依据
		- This survey contains some of the still-pending vague/difficult scenario from a recent overlap study.
